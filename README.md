# :zzz: LazyVim
> LazyVim is either full setup as LazyVim manages or as a plugin.
## Starter vs Plugin
#### :baby_bottle: Starter by LazyVim
- Template use [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim)
- Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to install Starter.
- Using started makes it difficult to remove unwanted plugins.
- No clear methodology, this approach sucked.
- Chosing managed by LazyVim means this repo is useless.

#### :building_construction: megavim uses as a plugin and selectively adds features.
- This repo started with blank slate, therefore is uncluttered.
- Has clear methodology, making it easy to maintain.
- Unwanted features are fully removable by deleting unwanted lua file under plugins folder
- Wanted features just add the lua file following the plugins instructions according to LazyVim.
